# My Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a fully responsive, single-page application built with React and TypeScript, designed to showcase my skills and projects in a clean, modern, and highly interactive format. The site features a dynamic theme that adapts to the user's system preferences (light/dark mode) and is packed with smooth animations powered by Framer Motion.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

This portfolio was built using a modern and powerful stack to ensure a high-quality user experience and maintainable codebase.

* **Core Framework:**
    * **React:** For building the component-based user interface.
    * **TypeScript:** For adding static typing and improving code quality.

* **Animation:**
    * **Framer Motion:** Used for all page load animations, scroll-triggered effects (like the disappearing header), active tab indicators, and other UI motion effects.
    * **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Powers the complex, interactive grid backgrounds that follow the user's mouse.

* **Styling:**
    * **CSS Modules / Component-Based CSS:** For component-scoped styles.
    * **CSS Variables:** For creating a seamless and themeable design that adapts to light and dark modes automatically.

* **Utilities:**
    * **React Intersection Observer:** To detect when sections scroll into view, triggering animations and updating the active navigation links.

* **Dynamic Sidebars:** Left and right sidebars for navigation and social links that appear as you scroll and hide on the contact page for a cleaner layout.
* **Active Link Highlighting:** The current section is always highlighted in the sidebars and header for clear navigation.
